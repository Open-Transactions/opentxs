// NOTE: Windows has different semantics than all other platforms for library
// symbol visibility especially with regards to templates. Templates on Windows
// can not be marked dllexport until they can be fully instantiated whereas on
// all other platforms they must be marked with default visibility at the point
// of declaration. To properly export extern templates on Windows it must be
// marked dllimport at the point of declaration (for the benefit of library
// users), and dllexport at the point where it is instantiated.

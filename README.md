The Open-Transactions project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
commercial-grade, fully-featured, free-software toolkit implementing the OTX
protocol as well as a full-strength financial cryptography library, API, CLI,
and prototype server. The project is managed by a worldwide community of
volunteers that use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the
Open-Transactions toolkit and its related documentation.

### About

Open-Transactions democratizes financial and monetary actions. You can use it
for issuing currencies/stock, paying dividends, creating asset accounts,
sending/receiving digital cash, writing/depositing cheques, cashier's cheques,
creating basket currencies, trading on markets, scripting custom agreements,
recurring payments, escrow, etc.

Open-Transactions uses strong crypto. The balances are unchangeable (even by a
malicious server.) The receipts are destructible and redundant. The transactions
are unforgeable. The cash is untraceable. The cheques are non-repudiable. Etc.

This product includes software developed by Ben Laurie for use in the Lucre
project.
